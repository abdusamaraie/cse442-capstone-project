# THESE INSTRUCTIONS ARE FOR THE INITIAL SETUP AND DEPLOYMENT OF THE NEO4J GKE CLUSTER


1. Manually create GKE cluster with 3 nodes. 
    Following: https://medium.com/google-cloud/running-neo4j-with-hosted-kubernetes-in-google-cloud-b479e87b74c0

2. Connect to the cluster with: 
    - gcloud container clusters get-credentials <cluster-name> --zone <zone> --project <project-name>
    - kubectl proxy

3. cd into "/kubernetes-neo4j"
    - Run kubectl apply -f cores

4. After the pods are done being created (this may take a few minutes), go to GKE/Services and go to <load-balancer-ip:80> in your browser.

5. In the Neo4J browser:
    Host: bolt://<load-balancer-ip>:7687
    Username: neo4j
    Password: neo4j
    - You will be asked for a new password. IT MUST BE "password"
      New Password: password

6. Change the neo4j IP in our back-end server.
    /back-end/server/constants/constants.py
    Change NEO4J_CLUSTER_IP to the IP of the load-balancer
