# THESE INSTRUCTIONS ARE FOR THE INITIAL SETUP OF THE FLASK GKE CLUSTER
# IF THE "flask" GKE CLUSTER ALREADY EXISTS, SKIP THESE STEPS


1. Manually create GKE cluster named "flask-cluster" with 3 nodes.

2. Connect to the cluster with: 
    - gcloud container clusters get-credentials flask-cluster-1 --zone us-central1-a --project cse442
    - kubectl proxy

3. From "cse442/back-end"
    - Run: kubectl apply -f flask-cluster.yaml

4. After the pods are done being created (this may take a few minutes), go to GKE/Services and go to <flaskapp-ip:80> in your browser to verify.

5. TO UPDATE THE FLASK IMAGE THAT'S BEING USED, YOU WILL NEED TO PUSH TO MASTER/DEVELOP
